Good Things Take A Little More Work by Suzie Bitner

I once heard an old man say, 
Shaping vases out of clay,
Into subtle forms sublime, 
Into different shapes and forms, 
LISTEN, SON, GOOD THINGS TAKE TIME

All my life I've thought of this
When a task was lacking bliss, 
When the work seemed awfully tough
And i thought I'd had enough. 

So I'd give a little more
To what sometimes seemed a chore;
And, you know, without a doubt, 
Good things always came about.

Good or Bad
It's not about what you have
But about how you use it
Nothing is good or bad
Unless you choose to make it so 

Before you blame a trait
Think about what you can do 
To turn things around
And make it work for you

Your Best 

If you always try your best
Then you'll never have to wonder
About what you could have done
If you'd summoned all your thunder

And if your best
Was not as good 
As you hoped it would be, 
You still could say, 
I gave today
All that I had in me

A Prayer 
a prayer for you today,
May the love of God ever with you stay.
Wherever you are, whatever you do, 
May the blessing of God ever rest on you. 
May the blessing of God ever rest on you, 
And in the years that are still to come, 
May the peace of God be in your home
And Gods great love abide with you

High school poem 
The wind howls
The swing sways
The roof house tops sheets clatter and clang 
The open window shut with a bang
And the sky makes the night of the day
