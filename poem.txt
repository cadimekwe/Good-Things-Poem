Good Things Take A Little More Work 

I once heard an old man say, 
Shaping vases out of clay,
Into subtle forms sublime, 
Into different shapes and forms, 
LISTEN, SON, GOOD THINGS TAKE TIME

All my life I've thought of this
When a task was lacking bliss, 
When the work seemed awfully tough
And i thought I'd had enough. 

So I'd give a little more
To what sometimes seemed a chore;
And, you know, without a doubt, 
Good things always came about.
